iOS Tech Test for Scottish Power May 2024

This project uses MVVM split into 2 views, 2 viewmodels and a networking service, with a Track model behind it.

Future considerations:

- Some refactoring, the views themselves can be refactored further for a cleaner codebase
- More Unit tests
- Paginating results for more results
- Another content page to allow different genres
- pull to refresh
